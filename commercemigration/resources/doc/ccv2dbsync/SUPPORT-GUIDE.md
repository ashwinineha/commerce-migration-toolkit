# CMT - Azure Database Sync

It allows you to synchronize the data you select single-directionally (from CCV2) across multiple MS databases, both on-premises and in the cloud.
It has the following properties:

* The Sync Schema describes which data(table/items) is being synchronized.
* The Sync Direction is only single-directional, which is from CCV2 to Onprem or another cloud MS Database.
* The Sync Interval describes how often synchronization occurs.

## When to use

It is useful in cases where data needs to be kept updated across databases in Azure SQL Database or SQL Server.

 It's beneficial to separate different workloads across different databases. For example, if you have a large production database, but you also need to run a reporting or analytics workload on this data, it's helpful to have a second database for this additional workload.

## CMT changes to support data sync

Following high-level changes in CMT for Data Synchronization:

* Cronjob for full migration
* Cronjob for incremental migration
* Commerce Azure [read-only DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/read-scale-out) as Source data source (it will not impact performance of the primary db)
* Reporting DB as Target Data

## Methodology for Data Sync

* Identify the tables you would like to sync (limit to the minimum that is required, avoid large table when possible (ex: do not sync task logs!)
* Remove/Add indexes that are not necessary in the target db
* Create indexes on last modified timestamp for tables that supports incremental
* Full data migration with all tables
* Run incremental regularly (example every hour)
* Reconfigure full data migration cronjob to sync tables with no last modified timestamp
* Run full data migration cronjob regularly and during low activity (e.g. every day, 3PM)
* Ensure data migration cronjobs are running on read-only

## Limitations with Data Sync

The following limitations should be considered when implementing CMT for data sync:
* Not all tables contain last modified timestamp
   * Some master data tables (LP tables, Auditâ€¦) will not contain timestamp column 
   * Should not be an issue, most of the time
   * You should ensure these tables are not too large
* No support for delete in the data source
   * Should not be a issue for most of the cases
   * In case, it is needed, you should implement you own strategy (e.g. interceptor on delete model service, new status to flag the row as deleted)
* Incremental update may create data integrity issue between two runs
   * During the cronjob execution, you may have some updates or creations that are not sync
   * There is no guaranty that some tables with relations may be partially sync, example Orders vs Orders items,
   * This should be acceptable for reporting or analytics, should be take into consideration for the application using the destination DB)
* Sync of master data (tables without last modified timestamp) may be delayed (e.g. 24 hours)
* Performance should be tested to tune batch size and number threads (memory and CPU on the application server)

## CronJob Configuration reference Data Sync

DataSync is managed by Cronjobs, which allow you to trigger full and interval Sync based on sync interval.

Following High-level details for the Cronjobs,
#### FullMigrationCronJob
It allows you to sync the full based on the list provided in CronJob settings.

#### IncrementalMigrationCronJob
It allows you to sync the delta based on modifiedTS hence tables must have the following columns: modifiedTS, PK. Furthermore, this is an incremental approach... only modified and inserted rows are taken into account. Deletions on the source side are not handled.
